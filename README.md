# RollerCoasterPark

A full-stack web application with the purpose of making Theme Park management much easier. Granting customers the ability to view available attractions, and purchase tickets. Employees the ability to log in to inform maintenance of any issues with a rollercoaster, and the management basic employee modification capabilities, and the ability to shop for new Attractions.

Implements API calls in java, docker containerization of an app, kubernetes, and build automation with Jenkins.
The idea was to practice building a dev ops pipeline with an actual project for practice. This project consisted of me and 5 other engineers.
